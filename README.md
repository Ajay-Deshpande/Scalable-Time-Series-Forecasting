# Scalable Time Series Forecasting in Spark: Prophet, CNN, LSTM, and SARIMA

## Overview

This project explores scalable time series forecasting techniques implemented in Apache Spark, including Prophet, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average). Each method offers unique advantages and is tailored to handle different characteristics of time series data.

## Content

### Prophet Forecasting
- Utilizes Facebook's Prophet library for time series forecasting.
- Prophet is well-suited for datasets with seasonality and holidays.
- The library provides intuitive APIs and handles outliers and missing values effectively.

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Implements CNN-based forecasting models.
- CNNs are capable of capturing local patterns and relationships in time series data.
- This approach is useful for capturing short-term dependencies and complex patterns in the data.

### Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks
- Develops LSTM-based models for time series forecasting.
- LSTM networks are capable of capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data.
- This approach is suitable for modeling complex temporal relationships and capturing nonlinear patterns.

### SARIMA Modeling
- Applies Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models for time series forecasting.
- SARIMA is a traditional statistical method known for its effectiveness in handling seasonal data.
- This approach is useful for capturing seasonal patterns and trends in the data.

## Conclusion

By exploring multiple approaches to time series forecasting in Apache Spark, this project demonstrates the versatility and scalability of different techniques. Each method has its strengths and can be applied based on the characteristics of the data and the specific forecasting requirements. The project provides insights into the performance and suitability of each approach, helping practitioners make informed decisions when forecasting time series data at scale.
